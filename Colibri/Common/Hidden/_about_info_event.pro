; NAME: 
; 
;   _About_Info_event
;
; PURPOSE:
;  
;   This function is called whenever a button in the status window is pressed.
;     - If the 'Logo' button is pressed the procedure _Handle_About is called which creates the required info
;       window depending on the requisted logo-bitmap in the status window. This procedure creates a button 
;       widget with a bitmap holding the user information. When this button is pressed the _About_Info_event
;       procedure is called automatically which on its turn destroys the information window.
;     - If the LED status button is pressed the status window is destroyed.
;
