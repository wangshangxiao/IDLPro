This directory contains the files required to work with the
IDL Programming Techniques book by David Fanning, published
by Fanning Software Consulting. The directory was updated to
work with the 2nd Edition of IDL Programming Techniques on
1 September 1998. If you are using the first edition of the
book, you will find the correct files in:

   ftp://ftp.dfanning.com/pub/dfanning/outgoing/coyote/archive_1

Description of Files:

   Files ending in "pro": IDL program files.
   Files ending in "txt": Information-only text files.

Copying the Data Files:

   Use the COPYDATA program file that is among the IDL program 
   files you can downloaded to copy the IDL example data file to
   your working directory. For example, like this: 

   1. Create a directory where you want the data files to be stored
      on your machine. For example:

      %mkdir /usr/local/rsi/idl51/coyote

   2. Download the copydata.pro program file to this directory.

   3. Enter IDL and change to this directory. For example:

      %IDL
      IDL> CD, '/usr/local/rsi/idl52/coyote'

   4. Run the COPYDATA program.

      IDL> COPYDATA

   5. If you have problems, please read pages 5-6 in the book. If
      you still have problems, contact Fanning Software Consulting
      via e-mail at problems@dfanning.com.

Downloading the IDL Program Files:

   You can either download the 54 IDL program files individually, as you
   need them, or all at once in compressed format. Individual files should
   be downloaded in ASCII mode. All compressed format files should be
   downloaded in BINARY mode. I recommend you download all the files at 
   once.

   bugs in them, please contact me immediately.

   These files have been updated to work with Feb 99 version of the IDL Programming
   Techniques book. This version uses IDL 5.2. If you find that some of these
   files don't work on your version of IDL, try copying files with the same
   names as the ones that don't work from the coyote/archive_2 subdirectory.
   If they still don't work, please contact me at the e-mail address above
   immediately.
